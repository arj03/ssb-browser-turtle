# ssb-turtle

SSB-turtle is a way to run multiple
[ssb-browser](https://github.com/arj03/ssb-browser-core) applications
from the same domain. Instead of having a central store for apps, you
load apps from your friends. All data for the apps are fetched as
messages and blobs and stored locally so the apps can run offline.
